# Sliding Puzzle
A sliding puzzle implementation using Python Tkinter. To play, first install
the following Python packages.
* Tkinter
* OpenCV
* NumPy (required by OpenCV)

Then download/clone this repository. Finally, open a terminal to the
download/clone location and run `python3 main.py crysis2.png` and enjoy!

If you want to use a different image (say, 'myimage.jpg'), delete the cached
image files (`rm img*.png`) and specify your new image on the command line
(`python3 main.py myimage.jpg`) and it should work. Just make sure that
'myimage.jpg' is a square image. Otherwise, the results may not be as expected.
